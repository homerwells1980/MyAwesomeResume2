Hello there,

Following the instructions I received from Sierra, I've decide to code this little resume service in C#.

It does make things a bit harder to test for you guys if you don't have IIS installed. So what I did instead
was to build a quick HTTP connection server so that you could try this out using your browser and localhost. All
you're gonna need to is to have a Windows 7 computer and install the .NET framework 4.0

Here's the link for it:

If you want to build the solution, you'll need Visual Studio 2010. Just double click the sln file and press F5 to run the service.

If you just want to use it, just download the MyAwesomeResume.zip file, unzip to any folder and run MyAwesomeResume.exe. 

You can test it with any of the URLs supported. Here they are:

http://localhost:12345/myawesomeresume/
http://localhost:12345/myawesomeresume/education/
http://localhost:12345/myawesomeresume/jobs/
http://localhost:12345/myawesomeresume/education/
http://localhost:12345/myawesomeresume/personalData/
